Kick off your project with this template. This template ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

**LIVE DEMO:** https://pageitup-investmate.netlify.app/

## 🚀 Quick start

1. 💫 **Deploy**

    [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/vegardloewe/templates-investmate)

    Instantly build and deploy your sites to our global network from Git. Custom domains, https, deploy previews, rollbacks and much more.

2.  **Navigate to your new repository.**

    Navigate into your new site’s repository and access it locally.

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-website/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `my-website` directory in your code editor of choice and edit components listed in `src/pages/Landingpage.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
